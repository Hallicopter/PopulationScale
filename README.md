# Population-Scale Persona & Survey Toolkit  
_A three-script pipeline for fabricating whole focus-groups out of thin air, grilling them with questions, and ogling the data in a browser—faster (and cheaper) than scheduling a single real Zoom._

<a id="why"></a>
## 1 · Why does this exist?
Because interviewing 10 000 real humans is expensive, messy, and occasionally illegal.  
So we let an LLM spin up synthetic humans—**Personas-as-a-Service**. Point the gizmo at a demographic slice (“20–28, female, Manhattan, well-to-do”) and a research prompt (“Will you watch this Twitch-style tech show?”). Out pops structured opinion data you can chart before your latte cools.

> **Contrarian Paradox™**  
> LLM personas are brilliant at spitting out **averages**; they’re allergic to genuine, fat-tail weirdness. Great for N = 100 sentiment charts, terrible if you’re scouting the next Tyler Cowen hot-take.

## 2 · Feature Fly-over

| Script | Elevator pitch |
|--------|----------------|
| **`01_generate_personas.py`** | Mints personas with names, bios, Big-Five scores, mood sliders, value stacks—even a “candor” dial. |
| **`02_run_survey.py`** | Feeds each persona your question. Options: self-consistency rerolls, reflection (“think step-by-step, dear NPC”). |
| **`03_visualize.py`** | Legacy CLI heat-map for terminal nostalgics. |
| **`app.py`** | Flask UI—click an opinions file, browse results, feel like Nate Silver. |

## 6 · Sample Results & What They Whisper

### Interest Snapshot  *(13 synthetic respondents)*

| Disposition | # | Share |
|-------------|---|-------|
| **Would watch TBPN** | 2 | **15.4 %** |
| **Would _not_ watch** | 10 | **76.9 %** |
| **Undecided / “Maybe”** | 1 | **7.7 %** |

### What the focus-group murmured

| They’re **in** because… | They’re **out** because… |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| “Fast-paced, irreverent sports-talk vibe.” | “Chaotic / hype-over-substance.” |
| “Unfiltered founder + VC war stories.” | “Tech chatter is oversaturated.” |
| “Courtside energy—no corporate fluff.” | “Prefer deeper, slower analysis.” |

**Cheer squad archetype**

* Startup operators who mainline Twitter Spaces.  
* Viewers preferring **banter-first, CNBC-meets-Twitch** energy.  
* Folks chasing founder lore unavailable in mainstream press.
